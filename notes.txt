Bugs:
- display loading state!

- save window position
- show text "Directory is empty" when it's empty
- options in main menu for: go parent
- correct work with "~" in directory name

Todo:

- open archives on the fly (or maybe mount them using gio)
- ability to display file data in table, column settings

gio:
- don't deal with drives
- listen for volumes (there can be unmounted volumes)
- listen for mounts (there can be network mounts without volumes)
- main list is list of all volumes and all non-volume mounts
- be careful, don't forget g_object_unref etc
- managing volumes (not sure if it's ok):
  - mount volume
  - unmount volume
  - stop drive
  - eject (?)
