Bugs:
- file icons slow for network fs
- move watcher to separate thread
- path buttons: head button for home, any bookmark
- add unref's and free's to gtk code
- path toolbar for "places/mounts"

Todo:
- navigation history; hotkeys; quick search in history
- watch for changes in network fs
- undo
- back/forward
- possibility to interrupt current task
- async message box
- view/edit file, adjustable commands
- unmount, eject, safely remove
- mount uri "archive://encoded_archive_uri/" when user goes into an archive; unmount on cdup
- files list as table (date, owner, mode etc), adjustable columns
- option "list folders before files"
- gvfs mount with password and other questions
- bookmarks support (use and edit)
- unix drives list
- display count of selected items, total space used by them, free space on current volume
- copy (details mode / fast mode), move, make sort/hard links, rename, remove, move to trash
- ask overwrite and error settings before starting operation
- select all, unselect all, invert selection, select/unselect by regexp
- progress in unity taskbar
- get icon using libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-info.c
- copy selected file names to clipboard (only filename, full path, full network path)
- display mime-type as is / human readable name
- run tasks in the same time / in queue
- set max copy speed
- icons for "places" menus
- file search
- resizeable splitter between panes; saving state of splitter
- ctrl+x/c/v
- drag and drop



Benefits:
- Use system color theme, no crazy colors.
- Allow to use and change hotkeys for everything.
- Display file icons from system theme.
- All filesystem operations are executed in separate thread.
- Featured integration with GIO/GVFS (network filesystems, external drives, archives etc).
