Bugs:
- don't update more than 1 time per second
- path buttons must not be uncheckable by user
- file icons slow for network fs
- ability to disable shortcut
- options in main menu for: menu "go"
- move watcher to separate thread
- path buttons: head button for home, any bookmark

Todo:
- try without gtk_main
- (!) add reporting about problems with reading a dir
- mount unmounted folder from mount list
- try to mount uri specified by user if it's not already mounted
- mount uri "archive://encoded_archive_uri/" when user goes into an archive; unmount on cdup
- menu switch between real path / uri in address bar
- files list as table (date, owner, mode etc), adjustable columns
- option "list folders before files"
- gvfs networking support (store passwords in wallet)
- bookmarks support (use and edit)
- unix drives list
- display count of selected items, total space used by them, free space on current volume
- copy (details mode / fast mode), move, make sort/hard links, rename, remove, move to trash
- ask overwrite and error settings before starting operation
- select all, unselect all, invert selection, select/unselect by regexp
- progress in unity taskbar
- get icon using libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-info.c
- buttons for smart path switcher
- copy selected file names to clipboard
- display mime-type as is / human readable name
- run tasks in the same time / in queue
- icons for "places" menu
- file search
- resizeable splitter between panes; saving state of splitter
- ctrl+x/c/v
- drag and drop


gio:
- don't deal with drives
- listen for volumes (there can be unmounted volumes)
- listen for mounts (there can be network mounts without volumes)
- main list is list of all volumes and all non-volume mounts
- be careful, don't forget g_object_unref etc
- managing volumes (not sure if it's ok):
  - mount volume
  - unmount volume
  - stop drive
  - eject (?)

Benefits:
- Use system color theme, no crazy colors.
- Allow to use and change a hotkey for everything.
- Display file icons from system theme.
