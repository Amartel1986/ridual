Bugs:
- file icons slow for network fs
- path buttons: head button for home dir
- add unref's and free's to gtk code
- don't delete tasks (don't set their parent), delete them after they're executed


Todo:
- open by uris if supported by app
- open several selected files in one instanse of the app


Edit:
  - separate shortcut for executing a file
  - view/edit file, adjustable commands
  - possibility to interrupt any current task
  - copy (details mode / fast mode), move, make soft/hard links, rename, remove, move to trash
  - extract archive to destination, extract here, browse into archive
  - ask overwrite and error settings before starting operation
  - progress in unity taskbar
  - copy selected file names to clipboard (only filename, full path, full network path)
  - run tasks in the same time / in queue
  - set max copy speed
  - ctrl+x/c/v
  - drag and drop


Browse:
  - editing column set
  - navigation history; hotkeys; quick search in history
  - back/forward
  - async message box
  - mount uri "archive://encoded_archive_uri/" when user goes into an archive; unmount on cdup
  - gvfs mount with password and other questions
  - files list as table (date, owner, mode etc), adjustable columns
  - option "list folders before files"
  - display count of selected items, total space used by them, free space on current volume
  - select all, unselect all, invert selection, select/unselect by regexp
  - get icon using libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-info.c
  - display mime-type as is / human readable name
  - icons for "places" menus
  - file search
  - resizeable splitter between panes; saving state of splitter
  - shortcuts for all standard places

Extra:
  - allow relative path in address bar; autocomplete in address bar on keyboard input
  - unmount, eject, safely remove
  - undo
  - edit bookmarks
  - unix drives list




Benefits:
- Use system color theme, no crazy colors.
- Allow to use and change hotkeys for everything.
- Display file icons from system theme.
- All filesystem operations are executed in separate thread.
- Featured integration with GIO/GVFS (network filesystems, external drives, archives etc).
- Useful navigation widget with buttons and context menu.
